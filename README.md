This project is a cybersecurity training project focused on web application vulnerabilities. It introduces us to common web attacks and teaches us how to identify and exploit them. There are 14 breaches to find, all aligned with the Open Web Application Security Project (**OWASP**).

## Setup

Starting the project, all we have is an `.iso`. Set the network's vm as host only and access to the website using the ip given by the VM.
